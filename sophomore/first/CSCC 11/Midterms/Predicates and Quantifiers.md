- Predicate refers to a property that the subject of the statement can have.

> [!tip] Breakdown
> **Ex.** $P(x):$ $x$ is greater than 3
> 
> 1. *"x"* is the subject of the statement
> 2. *"is greater than 3"* is the predicate

> [!success] Example
> Let $P(x)$ denote the statement $x\;>\;3$
> 
> 1. $\textbf{P(4):}\;4\;>\;3,$ is true
> 2. $\textbf{P(4):}\;2\;>\;3,$ is false

> [!success] Example
> Let $Q(x, y)$ denote the statement $x = y + 3$
> 
> 1. $\textbf{Q(1, 2):}\;1 = 2 + 3,$ is false
> 2. $\textbf{Q(3, 0):}\;3 = 0 + 3,$ is true

# Quantifiers

#### What is Quantification?
- Quantification is a way to create a proposition from a propositional function
- Quantification expresses the extent to which a predicate is true over a range of elements
	- Quantifier in Quantification are: all, some, many, none, and few
## Types of Quantification
#### 1. What is Universal Quantification?
- Universal Quantification is where a predicate is true for every element under consideration 
#### 2. What is Existential Quantification?
- Existential Quantification is where one or more element under consideration has a predicate that is true
