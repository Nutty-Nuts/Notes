- Relational Data Model was invented by Edgar Frank Codd of IBM in a paper entitles "A Relational Model for Large Shared Data Banks"
#### When was the Relational Data Model invented?
- Relational Data Model was introduced in June 1970

## About Relational Data Model
#### Why study the Relational Model?
We study the Relational Model because of the following:
	-  Most Widely used Model
	- Object Oriented Capability
	- XML features.

# Relational Data Model Concepts
---
#### What is a **Relation?**
- **Relation** is a mathematical concept based on the ideas of set.
- Relation is physically represented as a table with rows and columns
	- Relation is synonymous term to Table
#### What is the **Relational Data Model** in relation to Relation?
- **Relational Data Model** is based on the concept of a relation.
#### What is a **Relational Database?**
- **Relational Database** is a collection of Relations. See [[#What is a Relation?]]
## Characteristics of a Relation
#### What are the **Characteristics of a Relation?**
- The Characteristics of a Relation are the following:
	-  Relation Name must be Unique
	- Cells of the Relation must contain an Atomic Value
	- Columns or Attributes Names must be Unique
	- Values of a column are values of the same attribute known as the attribute domain
	- Tables must have an Identifying Attribute or a Key Attribute
	- No Duplicate Rows
	- Order and Arrangements of Rows are Irrelevant
#### What is an **Unnormalized Relation?**
- **Unnormalized Relation** is a table that satisfies all Characteristics of a Relation except some entries contain repeating groups or do not contain Atomic values.
#### What are Rows called in a Relation?
- Rows in a Relation are called **Records** or **Tuple**
#### What are Columns called in a Relation?
- Columns in a Relation are called **Fields** or **Attributes**

## Relation Domain
#### What is a Relation Domain?
- Relation Domain is the set of allowable values for one or more attributes.
#### What are the Domain Types?
- The Domain Types are the following:
	1. Numeric Type
	2. Date and Time Type
	3. String Type
	4. Spatial Data Type
	5. JSON Data Type
## Relation Attributes
#### What is an **Attribute?**
- **Attribute** is a named column of a relation
## Relation Tuples
#### What are **Tuples?**
- **Tuple** is a rows of a table which contains a single record for that Relation
## Degree of a Relation
#### What is **Degree of Relation?**
- **Degree** or **Arity of a Relation** is the number of Attributes it contains
## Cardinality of a Relation
#### What is **Cardinality of a Relation?**
- **Cardinality of a Relation** is the number of Tuple it contains.
## Relation Schema and Relation Instance
#### What is a **Relation Schema?**
- **Relation Schema** specifies the name of the relation, plus name, and the domain type of each column
#### What is a **Relation Instance?**
- **Relation Instance** is a relation instance of the relation schema
