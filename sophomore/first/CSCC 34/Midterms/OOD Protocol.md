# Overview

## Purpose
#### What is Purpose?
- Purpose explains what the model is intended to study or simulate
## Entities, State Variables, and Scales
#### What are Entities?
- Entity is an object or actor that behave as a unit and may interact with other entities
#### What are State Variables?
- State Variables describe the state of an entity
#### What are Scales?
- Scales describe that amount of space or time represented in a simulation
## Process Overview and  Schedule
#### What is Process Overview and Schedule?
- Process Overview and Schedule provides a summary of the processes and rules that govern agent behavior and interactions
# Design Concepts
---
## Basic Principles
#### What are Basic Principles?
- Basic Principles explains the fundamental principles and assumptions on which the model is based on such as theories and hypothesis
## Emergence
#### What is Emergence?
- Emergence is a phenomenon where complex patterns or behaviors emerge from the interaction of individual agents in the model
## Adaptation
#### What is Adaptation?
- Adaptation explains how agents in their model adapt to their environment or other agents' behavior
	- The rules for making decisions or changing behaviors in response to stimuli
## Objectives
#### What are objectives?
- Objectives clarify the specific research questions or objective that the model is designed to address
## Sensing
#### What is Sensing?
- Sensing describes how agents perceive and gather information about their environment or other agents
## Interaction
#### What is Interaction?
- Interaction explains how agents interact with each other and with their environment
# Details
---
## Initialization
#### What is Initialization?
- Initialization provide details about how the model is initialized which includes the conditions for the agents and the environment
	- Initial state of the model
## Input Data
#### What is Input Data?
- Input Data specifies that external data or sources used in the model and describe how they are incorporated
## Submodels
#### What are Submodels?
- 
## Stochasticity
#### What is Stochasticity?
- Stochasticity explains the sources of randomness or stochastic processes within the model
## Observations
#### What are Observations?
- Observations describes that variables or data that will be collected or output from the model for analysis
## Validation
#### What is Validation?
- Validation discusses the steps taken to validate the model
