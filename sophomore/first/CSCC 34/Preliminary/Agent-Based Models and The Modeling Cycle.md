# Model
#### What is a Model?
- A **Model** is a ==mathematical representation of some real world event==, system, behavior, or natural phenomenon that is ==used to solve problems or answer questions about a system or a class of systems==
##### Evidences or Examples?
> [!quote] 
> **Jeltsch et al.** developed a simple agent-based model (ABM) that represented fox families in stationary home ranges and migration of young foxes, accurately simulating the spread of rabies over both space and time.
> *CSCC 34 Module 1 PDF, Page 7*

> [!info]
> A model is a purposeful simplification of a system for solving a particular problem (or category of problems).

# The Iterating Modeling Cycle
## Formulate the Question
#### Why do we need to formulate a research question question?
- A clear **research question** serves as a ==compass and filter for designing a model.==
##### Evidences or Examples
> [!example]
> What search strategy maximizes the rate of finding items if they are distributed in clusters?
*CSCC 34 Module 1 PDF, Page 20*

## Assemble Hypothesis
#### Why do we need to formulate a hypothesis?
- **Formulating a Hypothesis** is important since it allows us to ==identify processes and structures important to the question or problem we address.==
##### Evidences or Examples
> [!info]
>  It is important, though, to ask ourselves: Is it possible to answer our question using a more aggregated and thus simpler model?
> *CSCC 34 Module 1 PDF, Page 21*

### Approach
#### How can we approach the process of assembling a hypothesis?
- **Top-Down Approach** focuses on ==using identifying features or factors to assemble a hypothesis or model.==
##### Evidence or Example
> [!example]
> 1. What factors have a strong influence on the phenomena of interest?
> 2. Are these factors independent or interacting?
> 3. Are they affected by other important factors?
*CSCC 34 Module 1, Page 22*

> [!quote] Quote - External Resources
> A theory-driven, top-down approach capitalizes on identifying features a priori, reducing the costs to researchers by making the task of identifying if … then … profiles easier and more efficient.
> *Measuring and Modeling Persons and Situations, 2021 by Zayas V. and Shoda Y.*

### Simplification
#### Why do we need to simplify our model?
- **Simplification of a Model** is important because the ==simplest model allows us to develop understanding gradually== while iterating through the cycle
##### Evidence or Example
> [!quote]
> The modeling cycle must be started with the most simple model possible, because we want to develop understanding gradually, while iterating through the cycle.
> *CSCC 34 Module 1, Page 23*
### Advise
#### How do we advise our model?

## Choose Model Structure
#### How do you choose a model structure?
- **Choosing a Model Structure** is achieved through ==producing a written formulation of the model== which includes scales, entities, state variables, processes, and parameters.
##### Evidence or Example
> [!info]
> - Produce a written formulation of the model.
> - Producing and updating this formulation is essential for the entire modeling process, including delivery to our "clients" (our thesis committee, journal reviewers, research sponsors, etc.).
> - It includes scales, entities, state variables, processes, and parameters.
> *CSCC 34 Module 1 PDF, Page 26*

> [!example]
> - This step, for the Mushroom Hunt model, includes specifying
>	- How the space that hunters move through is represented (as square grids with size equal to the area the hunter can search in one time step).
>	- What kinds of objects are in the model (one hunter and the items it searches for).
>	- The state variables or characteristics of the hunter (the time it has hunted and the number of items it has found, and the time since last finding an item), and exactly how the hunter searches.
>*CSCC 34 Module 1 PDF, Page 27*
## Implement the Model
#### How do we implement our model?
- We can **Implement our Model** by ==using mathematics and computer programs== to translate our verbal model description into an animated object. 
##### Evidence or Examples
> [!info]
>  The most technical part, where we use mathematics and computer programs to translate our verbal model description into an "animated" object .
>  *CSCC 34 Module 1 PDF, Page 29*
#### Why do we use mathematics and computer programs to translate our model?
- By implementing our model through mathematics and computer programs, we can ==posses an implementation free from mistakes== which allows us to explore the consequences of our assumptions in a logical and rigorous way and see if our initial model is useful.
##### Evidences or Examples
> [!info]
> Our assumptions may be wrong or incomplete, but the implementation itself is, barring software mistakes, always right: it allows us to explore, in a logical and rigorous way, the consequences of our assumptions and see whether our initial model looks useful.
> *CSCC 34 Module 1 PDF, Page 29*
## Analyze the Model
#### Why do we want to analyze the model?
- By analyzing the model, we can see the following:
	- The outcomes of creating agents and their behaviors.
	- How and What agent behaviors can explain and predict important characteristics of real systems.
##### Evidence or Examples
> [!info]
> - Individual-based ecology : we do not just want to see what happens when we create some agents and make up their behaviors.
> - we want to see what agent behaviors can explain and predict important characteristics of real systems.
> *CSCC 34 Module 1 PDF, Page 31*

> [!example]
> Example: we could analyze the model by trying a variety of search algorithms and parameter values to see which produces the highest rate of finding items.

# Agent-Based Modeling
#### What is agent-based modeling?
- **Agent-Based Modeling** is ==computational or mathematical model for simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents== (e.g. people, things, places, and time).
##### Evidences or Examples
> [!info]
> ABMs are thus models where individuals or agents are described as unique and autonomous entities that usually interact with each other and their environment locally.
> *CSCC 34 Module 1, Page 33*

#### How does agent-based modelling differ from traditional modelling?
- Agent-Based Modelling is different from traditional modelling ==by being unsimplified== (e.g. effects of variables, space, time, or dimensions)
##### Evidence or Examples
> [!info]
> - ABMs are different because they are concerned with two and sometimes more levels and their interactions: we use them to both look at what happens to the system because of what its individuals do and what happens to the individuals because of what the system does.
> - ABMs are also often different from traditional models in being unsimplified in other ways, such as representing how individuals, and the environmental variables that affect them, vary over space, time, or other dimensions. ABMs often include processes that we know to be important but are too complex to include in simpler models.

## Agents
#### What are agents in agent-based modelling?
- **Agents** are unique and ==autonomous entities== that usually ==interact with each other and their environment locally.==
##### Evidences or Examples
> [!info]
> ABMs are thus models where individuals or agents are described as unique and autonomous entities that usually interact with each other and their environment locally.
> *CSCC 34 Module 1, Page 33*

> [!example]
> Example: Agents may be organisms, humans, businesses, institutions, and any other entity that pursues a certain goal.
> *CSCC 34 Module 1, Page 33*

## Adaptive Behavior
#### What is adaptive behavior in agent based models?
- **Adaptive Behavior** is when agents ==adjust their behavior in response to== the current state of themselves, other agents, and their environment.
##### Evidences or Examples
> [!info]
> Agents therefore use adaptive behavior: they adjust their behavior to the current states of themselves, of other agents, and of their environment
> *CSCC 34 Module 1, Page 34*

## Emergence
#### What is emergence in agent-based modeling?
- **Emergence** are system dynamics that are a ==result of how a system's individual components interact with and respond== to each other and their environment.
> [!info]
> Using ABMs lets us address problems that concern emergence: system dynamics that arise from how the system's individual components interact with and respond to each other and their environment
> *CSCC 34 Module 1, Page 35*
