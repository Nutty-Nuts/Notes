## Class Struggle

"Class is a communist concept" -Marger Thatcher, a very horrible person
"Class is a relationship to the prevailing mode of production" -Karl Marx

Each significant period in history is constructe around a particular mode of production

1. Specific ways of obtaining the necessaries of life
2. Specific social relationships between workers and those who control the mode of production
3. Specific social institutions

Base is society's means of existence.
Base consists of:

- Forces of Production, raw materials, tools, technology, workers, and skills
- Relations of Production, class relations of those engaged in production

Class is determined by one's relationship to the mode of production

- Slave Mode produces Master/Slave Relations
- Feudal Mode produces Lord/Peasant Relations
- Capitalist Mode produces Capitalist/Worker Relations

## Class in Itself (objective category) and Class for Itself (Subjective Category)

Class in Itself refers to an economic relationship
Class for Itself refers to a form of consciousness and lived practice

"A class is born in the class struggle. Only through such struggle does it develop into a social and historical foce" -Ernst Fishcer

## Consumption as Class Distinction

Dominant classes seek to impose their own tastes as if these were in fact universal tastes

Different classes have different patterns of consumption

Middle class are "compelled" to represent its interests as the common interest of all members of society..to give its ideas the form of universality, and represent them as the only rational and value ones
