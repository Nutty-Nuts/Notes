		- Arc or Edges is a connection between nodes
	3. **Parent**
		- Parent is the node above a given node connected by an Edge
	4. **Child** 
		- Child is the node below a given node connected by an Edge
	5. **Root** 
		- Root is a node that has no parent
	6. **Leaf** 
		- Leaf is a node that has no children
	7. **Length** 
		- Length is the number of edges in a path
	8. **Height**
		- Height is the maximum level of a node in the tree
	9. **Subtree** 
		- Subtree is any node of a tree that consists of its children and so on
	10. **Visiting** 
		- Visiting is when program control arrives at the node
	11. **Traversing** 
		- Traversing is to visit all nodes in some specified order
	12. **Level**
