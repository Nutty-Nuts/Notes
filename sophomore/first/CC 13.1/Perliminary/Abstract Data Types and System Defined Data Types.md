# Abstract Data Types
### Abstract Data Types
- **Abstract Data Types** are objects with well-defined behaviors and characteristics while hiding unnecessary implementation details.
- **Interfaces** is a programming structure or syntax that allows the computer to enforce certain properties on an object or class (e.g. methods)
	- Interfaces contain only **constants** and **method prototypes** or **signatures** (e.g. method names, parameters, types of return values).
	- Interfaces can implemented by more than one class and a class can implement more than one interface.

### User Defined Data Types
- **User Defined Data Types** are data types specified by the user.

### System-Defined Data Types
- **System-Defined Data Types** are data types provided by the programming language and offer basic data representation. 
	- **Primitive Data Types** are data types that represents a single value. 
	- **Reference Types** are any instantiable class.

### Objects in Java
- **Objects** are instances of Java Classes.
- **Objects** are considered variables of abstract data type.
