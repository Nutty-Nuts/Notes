### Definition of Algorithm
- Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure use for solving a problem or completing a task.

### Algorithm Design
- Top-Down Design is to design an algorithm by specifying complex pieces and then dividing them into successively smaller pieces. Complex to Simple.
- Bottom-Up Design is to design an algorithm by beginning at the very basic and building up as it goes. Simple to Complex

### Algorithm Complexity
- Time Complexity is the amount of time an algorithm needs to run to completion.
- Space Complexity is the amount of memory an algorithm needs to run to completion
- Time-Space Trade-Off is to find a compromise between time and space based on the requirements of a problem or task 

### Big-Oh-Notation
- **Big-Oh Notation** is mathematical notation that shows how efficient an algorithm is in the worst-case scenario relative to its input size.
	- **Constant Time Algorithms** has a constant runtime regardless of the input size.
	- **Logarithmic Time Algorithms** has a runtime that only increases as the input size doubles.
	- **Linear Time Algorithm** has a runtime that linearly proportional to the input size.
	- Quasi-linear Time Algorithm
	- Polynomial Time Algorithm
	- **Exponential Time Algorithm** has a runtime that is exponentially proportional to the input size.
	- Factorial Time Algorithm

### Structured Programming
- Sequence Construct is where lines of code are executed one after the other.
- Conditional Construct is where lines of code are executed based on some logical fact.
- Repetition Construct is where lines of codes are executed a number of times.
