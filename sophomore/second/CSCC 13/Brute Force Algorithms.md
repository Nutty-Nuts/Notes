# BRUTE FORCE ALGORITHMS
--- 
- Brute Force Algorithms are algorithms with a straightforward approach, usually based directly on the problem's statement and definitions of the concepts involved.
## Examples of Brute Force Algorithms
- Examples of Brute Force Algorithms are as follows:
	- Selection Sort
	- String Matching
	- Traveling Salesman Problem
	- Knapsack Problem
	- Assignment Problem
## Strengths of Brute Force Algorithms
- 
## Weaknesses of Brute Force Algorithms
# EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH
---
- Exhaustive Search is a brute force solution to a problem involving searching for an element with a special property *(permutations, combinations, or subsets)*
	- Runs in a realistic amount of time only on very small instances and usually have better alternatives
