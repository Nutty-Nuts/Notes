# GREEDY ALGORITHM
---
- Greedy Algorithm is an algorithm that constructs a solution to an optimization problem piece by piece through a sequence of choices that are: feasible, locally optimal, and irrevocable
	- Some problems, a greedy algorithm can produce an optimal solution
	- Most problems, a greedy problem cannot produce an optimal solution but can be useful for quick approximations
## Optimal Solutions using Greedy Algorithm
- The problems that a greedy algorithm can produce an optimal solution are the following:
	- Change Making for Normal Coin Denomination
	- Minimum Spanning Tree *(Kruskal's and Prim's MST)*
	- Dijkstra's Single-Source Shortest Paths
	- Simple Scheduling Programs
	- Huffman Codes
## Approximations using Greedy Algorithm
- The problems that a greedy algorithm can only produce an approximation are the following:
	- Traveling Salesman Problem
	- Knapsack Problem
	- Combinatorial Optimization Problem
