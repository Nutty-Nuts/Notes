# COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY
---
- Computational Complexity is the amount of effort to apply an algorithm and how costly the algorithm is
## Efficiency Criteria
- Computational Complexity has two criteria for efficiency:
	1. Time *(usually more important)*
	2. Space

## Logical Units
- Logical Units are used to express a relationship between the size and time to process

# ASYMPTOTIC COMPLEXITY
---
- Asymptotic Complexity is a function that is an approximation of the computational complexity of an algorithm
	- This achieved through the elimination of terms that of a function that do not substantially change the magnitude
