# DIVIDE AND CONQUER ALGORITHM
---
- Divide-And-Conquer Algorithms are algorithms that incorporate one of the following design strategies:
	- Divide an instance of a problem into two or more smaller instances
	- Solve smaller instances recursively
	- Obtain solution to original instance by combining these solutions

## Examples of Divide and Conquer Algorithms
- Examples of divide and conquer algorithms are the following:
	- Mergesort
	- Quicksort
	- Binary Tree Traversals
	- Multiplication of Large Integers
	- Closest-Pair Algorithm
	- Convex-Hull Algorithm
	- Binary Search
