- Dynamic Programming is an algorithm design technique for solving problems defined by recurrences with overlapping sub problems
## Problems Solved by Dynamic Programming Algorithms
- The problems that can be solved by dynamic programming algorithms are the following:
	- Fibonacci Sequence
	- Coin-Row Problem
	- Coin-Collecting Problem
	- Knapsack Problem
	- Floyd-Warshall's Algorithm
