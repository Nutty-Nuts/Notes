Early days of online interactions, users struggled with expressing the meaning of the message (absence of body language, tone and expressions)

This was especially difficult when communicating via text only context

Emoticons, and eventually Emojis, can fill in the gap left behind by facial expressions. This made it easier for users to identify the meaning of messages

#### Problem with Emoticons or Emojis
25% of the time, people would disagree with the meaning of certain emojis or emoticons. This problem is especially more prominent when sending emojis from one platform to another since different platforms have different designs for emojis

#### Non Verbal Communication
- Non Verbal Communication fills in the gaps of meaning during communication. (a person can understand the intention of a person via non verbal cues even)
##### Midas Touch Effect
- Touching or Gesturing a person will increase the probability of a person liking you

##### Socio Meter
- Socio Meter is a concept that the person subconsciously know how to measure how others values us

In video messaging non-face-to-face communication is it harder to establish eye contact with other people. This really messes with your socio-meter
