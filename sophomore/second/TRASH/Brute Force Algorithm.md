# BRUTE FORCE ALGORITHM
---
- **Brute Force Algorithm** a straight forward approach usually based directly on the problems statement and definitions of the concepts involved.
## Examples of Brute Force Algorithms
1. Selection sort
2. String Matching 
3. Travelling Salesman Problem
4. Knapsack Problem
5. Assignment Problem

$$\sum_{i=0}^{n-2} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n-1} 1 = \sum_{i=0}^{n-2}(n-i-1)$$
$$ \sum_{i=0}^{n-2}n - \sum_{i=0}^{n-2}i - \sum_{i=0}^{n-2}1$$
$$[n(n-2-0)+n] - [$$

# Exhaustive Search
- Exhaustive Search is an algorithm that generates all possible combinations in a set of elements.
