# PURPOSE OF TRENDS 
---
- Purpose of Trends is to reduce failures and costs of computer systems used by businesses.

# TECHNOLOGY
---
- 
## Bandwidth
- Bandwidth refers to the amount of work done in a given amount of time. *volume*, *throughput*
## Latency
- Latency refers to the speed in which work is accomplished. *speed*, *response time*

# POWER AND ENERGY
---
## Maximum Power 
### Voltage Indexing Methods
- Voltage Indexing Methods allows processors to slow down and regulate voltages with a wider margin which ***[ trade-off ]** results in lower performance.*
## Sustained Power Consumption
- Sustained Power Consumption is measured by Thermal Design Power or TDP which determines the cooling requirement
### TDP for Power Supplies
- Power Supplies typically exceed the Thermal Design Power or TDP of a computer system
### TDP for Cooling Systems
- Cooling Systems are usually designed to match the Thermal Design Power or TDP of a computer system
## Energy Efficiency
### Power
- Power refers to the amount electricity that is needed to power or operate a computer system
- Power Consumption is useful for setting constraints when designing a computer system
### Energy
- Energy refers to the amount of electricity used by the computer system in a given amount of time
- Energy Consumption is useful for comparing the efficiency between different computer systems.

# COST
---
## Learning Curve
- Learning Curve is a phenomenon in which manufacturing costs decrease over time.
## Yield
- Yield refers the percentage of manufactured devices that survive testing procedures.
