# BENCHMARK
---
- Benchmark is a method or process to measure the performance of a computer system or application.
## Real Applications
- Real Applications are the best choice of benchmarks to measure performance since real life applications have limited code modification and have limited access to code compilers and architectures.
## Benchmark Suites
- Benchmark suites are a collection of applications that measure processor performance

## Types of Benchmarks
---
### Desktop Benchmarks
- Desktop Benchmarks focuses more on Processor-Intensive Benchmarking and Graphics-Intensive Benchmarking.
### Server Benchmarks
- Server Benchmarks focuses more on Processor Throughput, I/O Systems, File Server Requests, Response Time, and Request-Level Parallelism

## Performance Results
- Performance Results should be reproducible since consumers rely on performance measurements in choosing computers

# STANDARDIZE PERFORMANCE EVALUATION CORPORATION (SPEC)
---
- Standardize Performance Evaluation Corporation or SPEC is consiedered as one of the most successful standardized benchmark applications
	- Targeted towards work stations

# PRINCIPLES OF COMPUTER DESIGN
---
## Exploiting Parallelism
- Exploiting Parallelism methods, such as Instruction Level Parallelism and Processor Level Parallelism, to enhance performance
- See [[Computer Systems#Instruction Level Parallelism]]
- See [[Computer Systems#Processor Level Parallelism`]]
- See [[Computer Systems#Pipelining]]

## Principle of Locality
- See [[Computer Systems#Principle of Locality]]
---
### Temporal Locality
- Temporal Locality is the probability that recently accessed data will be accessed again 
### Spatial Locality
- Spatial Locality is the probability that neighboring address around the requested address will be fetched soon

## Focusing on Common use
- Favor frequent and common cases over infrequent cases
## Amdahl's Law
- Amdahl's Law states that performance improvement to be gained from using some faster more of execution is limited by the fraction of the time the faster mode can be used.
