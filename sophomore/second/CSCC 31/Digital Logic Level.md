# GATES
---
- **Gates** are collections of transistors arranged in a manner that allows current to flow when specific conditions are met.
	- Gates are the hardware basis in which all digital computers are built.
### Types of Gates
- There currently five type of gates which are the following:
	1. NOT Gate
	2. NAND Gate
	3. NOR Gate
	4. AND Gate
	5. OR Gate
	
## Transistors
- **Transistor** is a component that amplifies or switches electronic signals depending on the voltage of the current. *(0V-0.5V as 1, and 1.0V-1.5V as 0)*
### Parts of a Transistor
- Transistors are composed of three connections which are:
	- Collector
	- Base
	- Emitter

# BOOLEAN ALGEBRA
---
- **Boolean Algebra** is a type of algebra where variable and functions can only take the values of 0 and 1.
## Boolean Function
- **Boolean Function** is a function that has one or more input variables and yields a result that depends on the values of these variables.
	- Boolean Function of $n$ variables has only $2^n$ possible combination of of input values.
## Truth Table
- **Truth Table** is a table that is used to show the possible outcomes of different combinations of truth values and can also be used on logical circuits.
### Addition
- Addition is represented as an OR Function in Logic
### Multiplication
- Multiplication is represented as an AND Function in Logic

# CIRCUIT EQUIVALENCE
---
- **Circuit Equivalence** is where two circuits, each with a different number of gates, produce the same output.

# INTEGRATED CIRCUIT 
---
- **Integrated Circuit** is a small of electronic device that is composed of multiple interconnected electrical components such as gates, transistors, resistors, and capacitors.

# Basic Digital Logic Circuits

## Combinatorial Circuits
- The following are Combinatorial Circuits:
	1. **Multiplexers**
		- Multiplexer is a circuit with multiple inputs and a single output
	2. **Decoders**
		- Decoders is a circuit with multiple inputs and multiple outputs
	3. **Comparators**
		- Comparators are circuits that compares two inputs.
		
## Arithmetic Circuits
- The following are Arithmetic Circuits:
	1.  **Shifters**
		- Shifters are circuits that performs bit shifting
	2.  **Adders**
		- Adders are circuits that perform addition using half adders and full adders
	3. **Arithmetic Logic Unit**
		- See [[CSCC 31/Computer Systems#Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)|Arithmetic Logic Unit]]
