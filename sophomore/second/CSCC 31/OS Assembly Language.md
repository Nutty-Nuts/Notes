# OPERATING SYSTEM
---
- Operating System is a program that introduces new instructions and features above and beyond what the ISA Level provides
### Operating System Machine or OSM Level
- Operating System Machine or OSM Level is the level that implements the operating system
### System Calls
- System Calls are the new instructions that invokes a predefined operating system service and are added by the Operating System or OS

## Virtual Memory
- Virtual Memory is a method to perform overlays automatically without the programmer even knowing
### Overlays
- Overlays are pieces of a divided program and written to and read from memory piece by piece

## Hardware Virtualization
---
- Hardware Virtualization is the combination of hardware and software support to allow simultaneous execution of multiple operating systems on the same physical computer 
### Virtual Machine
- Virtual Machine is a machine or computer that is virtualized or executed on a hast computer and appears to be a complete standalone system
### Hypervisor
- Hypervisor is a software component that creates and manages instances of virtual machines

## OSM-Level Instructions
- OSM-Level Instruction removes some damaging instructions from the ISA-Level Instruction and Implement System Instructions instead.
### OSM-Level I/O Instructions
- OSM-Level I/O Instructions separate input and output instructions into different levels to protect the ISA Level from data breach and reduce complexity.
### File
- File consists of a sequence of bytes written to an I/O deice

# ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE LEVEL
---
- Assembly Language Level translates programs into executable binary program rather than interpreting programs
	- Assembly Language uses translation rather than interpretation
## Object Program or Executable Binary Program
- Object Program or Executable Binary Program is a program that is translated from a high-level language to assembly language
### Steps
1. Generation of Equivalent Program to Target Language
2. Execution of the Newly Generated Program
## Properties
- Assembly Language Level gives programmers full access to all the features and instructions available on the target machine
- Assembly Language can only run on one family of machines

## Advantages
- The adva
