## Multi-level Machine
- Multi-level Machine refers to a computer system that is composed of different levels of abstractions *(L1, L2,... L5)*.
## Translation
- **Translation** is a process that translates a program or a set of instructions from a specific level into a program or a set of instructions that runs on a lower level. *ex. C/C++ Compiler*
## Interpretation
- **Interpretation** is a program that is written in at a lower level that examines, decodes, and executes programs or instructions written at a higher level. *ex. Python Interpreter*
## Virtual Machine
- **Virtual Machine** is a series of layers or levels that uses its preceding level as a basis.
## Abstraction
- **Abstraction** is the process of simplifying complex systems by hiding unnecessary details and underlying implementations.

# COMPUTER LEVEL SYSTEM HIERARCHY
---
## L0 or Digital Logic Level
- **Digital Logic Level** is the lowest level of abstraction of a computer system where the system is described in terms of binary numbers.
## L1 or Microarchitecture
- **Microarchitecture** is where digital logic components are organized and arranged to implement simple functions
- Microarchitecture serves as a bridge between the Digital Logic Level and the Instruction Set Architecture
## L2 or Instruction Set Architecture
- **Instruction Set Architecture** outlines the operations that the CPU can perform and the manner or method that the CPU accomplishes such operations.
## L3 or Operating System Machine Level
- **Operating System Machine Level** is where hardware and software resources are organized and managed. 
- Operating System Machine Level bridges the gap between hardware and software
## L4 or Assembly Language Level
- **Assembly Language Level** provides a way to write programs that can be executed in L1 to L3in a simple manner.
## L5 or Problem-Oriented Language Level
- **Problem-Oriented Language Level** provides different high-level languages that are used to solve specific problems.

## OTH Generation
- **OTH Generation of Computers** was when mechanical computers or calculators were invented and prominently used.
### Notable Technologies
1. Charles Babbage's Difference Engine and Analytical Engine
2. Konrad Zuse's Calculating Machines
3. John Antanasoff and George Stibbitz's Calculators
4. Howard Aiken's Mark I and Mark II

## 1ST Generation
- **1ST Generation of Computers** was when the first electronic computer was invented and marked the beginning of electronic computers
### Notable Technologies
1. *Vacuum Tubes*
2. Alan Turing's *COLOSSUS*
3. John Mauchley and J Presper Eckert's *ENIAC*
4. John von Neumann's *IAS Machine*
4. John von Neumann's *von Neumann Machine*
### von Neumann Machine
- von Neumann Machine is a computer that is composed of 5 parts which are the following:
	1. ALU
	2. Memory
	3. Control Unit
	4. Input
	5. Output
- The combination of the ALU and Control Unit forms the Central Processing Unit or CPU

## 2ND Generation
- **2ND Generation of Computers** was when transistors and omnibus were invented and introduced.
### Notable Technologies
1. Transistors
2. Omnibus

## 3RD Generation
- **3RD Generation of Computers** was when Integrated Circuits were invented.
### Notable Technologies
1. Multiprogramming

## 4TH Generation
- **4TH Generation of Computers** was when Very Large Scale Integration or VLSI was invented which allowed millions of transistors to be placed on a single chip.
### Notable Technologies
1. Personal Computers
2. Graphical User Interface or GUI

## 5TH Generation
- **5TH Generation of Computers** is when ubiquitous or pervasive computing was introduced which meant that computers are found and used everywhere and anywhere.
### Notable Technologies
1. Low-Power and Invisible Computers
2. Ubiquitous or Pervasive Computing
3. Smaller Computers
4. PDAs and Smartphones
