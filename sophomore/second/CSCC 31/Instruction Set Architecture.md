# INSTRUCTION ARCHITECTURE
---
> [!tip] Fact
> Historically, the Instruction Set Architecture or ISA was developed **before any of the other levels**

> [!note] 
> Instruction Set Architecture or ISA is commonly referred to as **the architecture** of the machine

-  Instruction Set Architecture or ISA defines the interface between the compilers and the hardware.

## Properties of Instruction Set Architecture Level

## Defining Document
- Defining Document is the collection of information that 
### Normative Sections
- Normative Sections contain the imposed requirements of an Instruction Set Architecture Level
### Informative Sections
- Informative Sections contain information that is used to help the reader but are not a part of the formal definition

## Backwards Compatibility

> [!note]
> Backwards Compatibility is a **massive consideration** when designing new machines or architectures

- **Backwards Compatibility** is the ability of an architecture to run or use software or hardware from the past.
## Characteristics of a Good ISA
- The Two Primary Factors that makes a good Instruction Set Architecture or ISA are the following:
	1. ISA can be implemented efficiently in current and future technologies which results in cost-effective designs over several generations
	2. ISA should provide a clean target for compiled code
