# APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
---
## Planning
- Planning Phase focuses on identifying the problem, gathering information needed to plan a solution, and a review of all available data.
## Requirements Analysis
- Requirements Analysis Phase aims to find out the requirements of the stakeholders. customers and users.
### System Analysis
- **System Analysis** is a feasibility study to know whether or not an idea or project is viable.

## Architecture Design
- Architecture Design Phase is where the designing of the user interface and user experience occurs.
### Sketch
- Sketching is where a hand-drawn or computer assisted drawing is created to serve as a concept of the app's UI/UX
### Wireframe
- Wireframe is where the concept of the application is translated or converted into a model that represents the application UI but without color, content, functionality, and interaction.
### Prototype
- Prototypes is where a clickable or interactable model of an application is created.

## Implementation
- Implementation Phase is where the application and its functionalities are implemented via programming.
## Testing 
- Testing Phase is where the application is run through a series of tests or unit tests to ensure the that the application is functional and free of defects
## Maintenance and Support
- Maintenance and Support Phase is where bug fixing, upgrades, and enhancement of the software occurs.
### Bug Fixing
- **Bug Fixing** is the process of fixing bugs reported by the user
### Upgrade
- **Upgrade** is the process of upgrading the application to newer versions of the software
### Enhancement
- **Enhancement** is the process of adding new features into the existing software

# TYPES OF MAINTENANCE

## Corrective Maintenance
- Corrective Maintenance is a type of maintenance where modifications and updates are performed on software to correct or fix problems.
## Adaptive Maintenance
- Adaptive Maintenance is a type of maintenance where modifications and updates are performed on software to keep the software up-to-date.
## Preventative Maintenance
- Preventative Maintenance is a type of maintenance where modifications and updates are performed on software to prevent future problems.

## Cost of Maintenance
- Cost of Maintenance is very high, totaling up to 67% of the cost of the entire software development life cycle
